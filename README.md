This Flask app provides for the creation and manipulation of users, posts, and tags.

It provides no authentication or other security.

The app uses a Prostgres database with the name 'blogly'. The tests use one named 'blogly_test'.

To seed a little bit of data, create the 'blogly' database and run seed.py.
